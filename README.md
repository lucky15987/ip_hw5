 Internet Programming Homework 5
 
Problem:

  Write a Python program which let the user input a website link and a file name. Then the program will send an HTTP request to the server. Finally, this program will create a new file according to the file name and save the response from the server into that file.
  
  Ex: 
  
     Sample input: www.google.com response.txt
     
     The result is the response will be saved into the file "response.txt".
